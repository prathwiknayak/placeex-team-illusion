A full-stack placement portal built with "React (Frontend)," "Node.js + Express (Backend)," and an "AI Chatbot" module.
This repository contains all three major components of the project in one place for easy reviewing, deployment, and debugging.
Our website name is PlaceEx, which is an AI-powered placement portal where seniors who are placed in different companies across the world can share their experience during their placement and the preparation they made, strategies, referred notes or links, etc.
AI takes the details from seniors and gives a complete time-based roadmap for juniors or people who are planning to give an interview.
We have also added an "ATS SCANNER" system where a user can upload his/her resume, and the scanner will rate it out of 10 and tell whether the resume is passed or failed.

Future development:
* Making the website more interactive and responsive.
*adding more features related to placements and interviews
*adding a chat section where users can interact directly with the seniors
